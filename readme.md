# 🌳 TreeVisual – Binary Tree Learning Companion

TreeVisual is a self-directed desktop project built to strengthen my understanding of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** for coding interview preparation.

It is a **fully offline, cross-platform binary tree learning widget**, packaged as:

- 🪟 Windows executable  
- 🍎 macOS executable  
- ❌ No internet required  
- ❌ No additional setup  

Designed to be lightweight and distraction-free, focusing on **concept clarity and hands-on interaction** rather than memorisation.
