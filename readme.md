Binary Tree Learning Widget

A self-directed personal project to hone my coding skills and revising dsa for preparing for coding interviews.

This is an offline, accessible binary tree learning widget accomodated
for everyone- especially students or alumni learning / revising data structures and algorithm.

As many learning tools out there require internet access- I am making one to make learning binary trees more accessible to anyone- and enhance understanding of concepts and applications.
