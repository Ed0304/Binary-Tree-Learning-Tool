# Binary Tree Learning Widget

A self-directed personal project to strengthen my coding skills and revise
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for coding interview preparation.

This project is an **offline, cross-platform binary tree learning widget**
packaged as a **Windows and macOS executable**, requiring **no internet
connection and no additional setup**.

The goal is to make learning and revising **binary tree concepts more
accessible**, especially for students or alumni who want a lightweight,
distraction-free tool they can run locally.

Unlike many online-only learning tools, this widget focuses on:
- Hands-on interaction
- Concept clarity over memorisation
- Practical understanding useful for interviews

## Features
- Binary tree visualisation
- Common operations (insert, delete, traversals)
- Step-by-step explanations
- Fully offline usage
- Runs as a standalone executable

## Target Audience
- Computer science students
- Fresh graduates preparing for coding interviews
- Anyone revising binary trees without reliable internet access

## Motivation
Built as a personal learning tool to reinforce DSA fundamentals while
developing a practical, distributable desktop application.
